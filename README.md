----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository called "AVL_Tree" is the project 1 of the course: programming laboratory. It has the implementation of a AVL_tree using c++ 14.

Structure:

* build: This folder contains the makefile to compile and run the program and the tests.
* src: this folder contains the source code of the avl tree data structure.
* test: this folder contains the main programs called main_nodes_id and the unit tests.
* include: this folder contains the header of the avl tree dator structure.
* misc: this fonder contains the read files for the main program "input", the output files "output" and the results of the execution speeds.

The makefail structure:

* all: compile the main program
* run: run the main program
* run_debug: run the main program with valgrind debugger
* unittest: compile the unit test program
* run_unittest: run the unit test program
